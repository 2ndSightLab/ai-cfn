# Instructions to Deploy a Static Website With a TLS Certificate and CLoudFront distribution

https://medium.com/cloud-security/code-to-deploy-a-website-hosted-in-an-s3-bucket-a-tls-certificate-and-cloudfront-distribution-9cdaf34d6a12

```
# You can run these commands in AWS CloudShell to test (for non-production websites!)
# Use these commands to run the scripts in the AWS account where the website exists
cd ~
rm -rf ai-cfn
git clone https://github.com/2ndSightLab/ai-cfn.git
cd ai-cfn/staticweb
chmod 700 deploy.sh
chmod 700 scripts/deploy-tls-cert-validation.sh
./deploy.sh

# Use these commands to run the script to update the name servers where the primary domain exists
# NOTE: If you have existing records set up on existing name servers this can mess things up!
# Use a test domain, not a production domain
cd ~
rm -rf ai-cfn
git clone https://github.com/2ndSightLab/ai-cfn.git
cd ai-cfn/staticweb
chmod 700 update-nameservers.sh
./update-nameservers.sh
```

For production website deployments there are many other considerations.
